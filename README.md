ImageAI provides convenient, flexible and powerful methods to perform object detection on videos. The video object detection class provided only supports the current state-of-the-art RetinaNet, while other object detection networks will be supported in the nearest future. This is a Preview release but capable lots of incredible options. To start performing object detection, you must download the RetinaNet object detection via the link below: 

- RetinaNet (Size = 145 mb)
